The following modules were not unloaded:
  (Use "module --force purge" to unload all):

  1) CCconfig         4) imkl/2020.1.217    7) libfabric/1.10.1
  2) gentoo/2020      5) intel/2020.1.217   8) openmpi/4.0.3
  3) gcccore/.9.3.0   6) ucx/1.8.0          9) StdEnv/2020

Lmod is automatically replacing "intel/2020.1.217" with "gcc/9.3.0".


Due to MODULEPATH changes, the following have been reloaded:
  1) libfabric/1.10.1     2) openmpi/4.0.3     3) ucx/1.8.0

The environment has already been set by the module.
Not making any changes.

MPI_ABORT was invoked on rank 0 in communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD
with errorcode 1.

NOTE: invoking MPI_ABORT causes Open MPI to kill all MPI processes.
You may or may not see output from other processes, depending on
exactly when Open MPI kills them.
